StateX is a powerful, yet easy state management solution. It makes use of the reactive state management and general state management to let your project manages states efficiently.


# Reactive State Management
One of the truly unique about this **stand-alone** state management library is that you can efficiently manage states reactively. To acheive this, StateX offers a reactiveState class which it's constructor accepts a function to call whenever you use it, or in other words, it performs a computation whenever needed rather than updating .
